# tinyapp

## Overview	
* The app allows the user to check time in different timezones. Currently, the functionality is limited to the US time zones and UTC. 
* The app has a radio button format on for selecting the timezone. Then, it uses the android widget, TimePicker. It displays the time in both analog and digital format.
* On the bottom, a random image is shown, just for fun!

## Running Requirements
* The app only runs on android devices. The minimum Android OS is Android 6.0 (Marshmallow)

## Documentation & Resources
* I installed Volley for using the internet, however I did not use the functionality due to time constraints. 
* Picasso is also installed to display the image.

## Experience
* This project was an incredible learning opportunity. I now realize how painful mobile development really is. I understand the different components of an app and how they are connected. I have a better understanding of what the manifest document is used for, and how to add different modules through Gradle Scripts.
* I also got experience with implementing different APIs, such as Volley and Picasso. Even though Volley is not implemented in the final version, I used it to test the basic HTTP request. 
* I also learned that the interface is very counter intuitive. For example, I cannot place a view or widget anywhere on the display screen. In order to do so, I have to modify the layout files.
* Nonetheless, I understand the importance of developing an app as it pushes independent work ethic. I am looking forward to creating a more fleshed out app and getting more annoyed with the platform.
